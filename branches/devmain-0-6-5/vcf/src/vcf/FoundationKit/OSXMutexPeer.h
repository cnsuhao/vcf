 *$Log$
 *Revision 1.1.2.4  2004/05/03 03:44:53  ddiego
 *This checks in a bunch of changes to the FoundationKit for OSX
 *porting. The thread, mutex, semaphor, condition, and file peers
 *have all been implemented and tested. The file peer could be improved
 *and needs search functionality. The locale peer is only partially
 *complete, but the functions will return values. The unicode transition
 *is also finished and works OK now.
 *
