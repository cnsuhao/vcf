/**
*CVS Log info
*$Log$
*Revision 1.1.2.1  2004/04/29 15:38:12  pallindo
*Initial attempt at an OpenGLKit
*
*Revision 1.1.2.1  2004/04/28 00:28:18  ddiego
*migration towards new directory structure
*
*Revision 1.6.4.1  2004/04/26 21:58:20  marcelloptr
*changes for dir reorganization: _VCF_MACRO_H__
*
*Revision 1.6  2003/12/18 05:15:57  ddiego
*merge from devmain-0-6-2 branch into the stable branch
*
*Revision 1.5.6.3  2003/09/12 00:09:32  ddiego
*added better tabbing behaviour - fixed an earlier bug.
*Code is easier to understand and it simplified the implementation
*a bit as well
*Moved around the RTTI definitions for various Appkit classes to a
*single inline and stripped them from the various class headers
*
*Revision 1.5.6.2  2003/09/06 19:45:45  ddiego
*changes to ensure that the destroy() is properly called.
*Destructors were moved back to pbulic scope in case that was causing a bug.
*Moving them all(all teh component derived classes) to private scope causes
*a complete failure in hte VC6 compiler. Alas...
*So destructors are present, and modal dialogs can still be created on the
*stack, but almost any other component should be created on the heap, and
*gotten rid of via free() NOT using operator delete directly.
*also moved the vcs info to the end of the file for some of the headers
*This will be an ongoing process.
*
*Revision 1.5.6.1  2003/09/05 21:03:39  ddiego
*moved the various control destructor's to protected scope
*migrated code into destroy() overridden methods
*----------------------------------------------------------------------
*
*Revision 1.5  2003/02/26 04:30:38  ddiego
*merge of code in the devmain-0-5-9 branch into the current tree.
*most additions are in the area of the current linux port, but the major
*addition to this release is the addition of a Condition class (currently
*still under development) and the change over to using the Delegate class
*exclusively from the older event handler macros.
*
*Revision 1.4.20.1  2003/01/08 00:19:43  marcelloptr
*mispellings and newlines at the end of all source files
*
*Revision 1.4  2002/01/24 01:46:47  ddiego
*added a cvs "log" comment to the top of all files in vcf/src and vcf/include
*to facilitate change tracking
*
