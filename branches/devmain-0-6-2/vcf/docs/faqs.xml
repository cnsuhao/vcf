			<question>
				<para>Why are you writing another framework ? Aren't there enough out there ?</para>
			</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
				The Visual Component Framework (VCF) was designed to make application 
				programming in general, particularly applications with User Interfaces, 
				much easier than it currently is with typical development tools. In addition 
				it was created to be cross platform in design, so a program relying only 
				on features within the VCF should simply recompile on another platform 
				supported by the VCF.
