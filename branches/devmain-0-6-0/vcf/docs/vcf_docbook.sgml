				<question>
					<para>Why are you writing another framework ? Aren't there enough out there ?</para>
				</question>
				<answer>
					<para>
					The Visual Component Framework (VCF) was designed to make application 
					programming in general, particularly applications with User Interfaces, 
					much easier than it currently is with typical development tools. In addition 
					it was created to be cross platform in design, so a program relying only 
					on features within the VCF should simply recompile on another platform 
					supported by the VCF.
