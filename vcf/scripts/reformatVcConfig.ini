# Configuration file for dsp.py
#  - you can give any name you want to the all the sections beside the first [activesection]
#  - you can give any name you want to the entries in the dirlist and excludesubdirlist sections
#  - all the options are sotored first and then parsed
# Note: the options with [*] have three pssible values: 
#       [ -1 -> remove/disable the option ] [ 0 -> does nothing ] [ 1 -> add/activate the option ]
#       At the same times each option is managed by the script in a sensible way, i.e. they are
#           never removed if that would compromise the possibility to compile the project
#           These choices are hardcoded in few places of the script


# this section set the name of the configuration section you want to use
[activesection]
#  - the name of the entry in this section must exist be the name of an existing section
#    current choices are: vcfscript / deleteSccOnly / conformAllLibraries / test
section = vcfscript
