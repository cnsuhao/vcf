*Revision 1.6.4.1  2003/10/23 04:24:51  ddiego
*more musical chairs with headers again, in yet another attempt to make
*them more efficent to speed up compiles.
*Removed all teh template RTTI classes and put them all in one header
*called VCFRTTIImpl.h. This should help compile speeds a bit.
*The next step is to look at some of the event classes and remove ones
*that aren't really neccessary - I'd estimate that 50% of the current
*event classes are unneccessary and can be removed.
*
*Revision 1.6  2003/05/17 20:37:13  ddiego
*this is the checkin for the 0.6.1 release - represents the merge over from
*the devmain-0-6-0 branch plus a few minor bug fixes

* <name>"_" suffix nameing standard.
*Also changed all vcf builder files to accomadate this.
*Changes were made to the Stream classes to NOT multiple inheritance and to
*be a little more correct. Changes include breaking the FileStream into two
*distinct classes, one for input and one for output.
*
*Revision 1.5  2002/06/25 01:25:28  ddiego
*added some fixes and documentation to the Thread class
*also added methods to allow for getting the peer classes on the
*Thread, Semeaphore, and Mutex classes. added peer methods for
*retrieving the handleID for a thread,semaphore, or mutex
*
*Revision 1.4  2002/05/09 03:10:43  ddiego
*merged over code from development branch devmain-0-5-1a into the main CVS trunk

*Revision 1.3  2002/03/18 00:20:44  ddiego
*made changes to foundation kit stuff so that the thread, mutex, semaphore, registry,
*file, filestream, and library class all call the SystemToolkit to create their peer
*instances.
*
*Revision 1.2  2002/01/24 01:46:48  ddiego
*added a cvs "log" comment to the top of all files in vcf/src and vcf/include
*to facilitate change tracking
