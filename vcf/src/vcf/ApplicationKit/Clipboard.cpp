*Revision 1.4.2.3  2003/07/24 04:10:43  ddiego
*added fixes for the following tasks:
*Task #82279 ApplicationKit: add static methods to singleton objects
*Task #82277 FoundationKit: add static methods to singleton objects
*this required a bunch of changes in terms of getting rid of older style code
*
*Revision 1.4.2.2  2003/06/27 03:10:58  ddiego
*got rid of some redundant junk in the Clipboard and DataObject
*classes. Instead of a rather dippy use of the DataType calss, we now simply
*use pure mime-types to identify the various "flavours" of data.
*
*Revision 1.4.2.1  2003/05/25 19:07:15  ddiego
*fixed bug [ 524878 ] onDropped not called for MLTcontrol. This
*was due to errors in the drag-drop implementation for WIn32 and is
*now fixed.
*Also cleaned up the drag-drop implementation and moved/deleted a number of
*irrelevant files for COM support. The vcf/include/com and vcf/src/COM
*directories are now gotten rid of.
*
*Revision 1.4  2003/05/17 20:37:47  ddiego
*this is the checkin for the 0.6.1 release - represents the merge over from
*the devmain-0-6-0 branch plus a few minor bug fixes
*
*Revision 1.3.2.2  2003/03/23 03:24:00  marcelloptr
*3 empty lines at the end of the files
*
*Revision 1.3.2.1  2003/03/12 03:13:00  ddiego
*switched all member variable that used the "m_"<name> prefix to
* <name>"_" suffix nameing standard.
*Also changed all vcf builder files to accomadate this.
*Changes were made to the Stream classes to NOT multiple inheritance and to
*be a little more correct. Changes include breaking the FileStream into two
*distinct classes, one for input and one for output.
*
*Revision 1.3  2003/02/26 04:30:54  ddiego
*merge of code in the devmain-0-5-9 branch into the current tree.
*most additions are in the area of the current linux port, but the major
*addition to this release is the addition of a Condition class (currently
*still under development) and the change over to using the Delegate class
*exclusively from the older event handler macros.
*
*Revision 1.2.14.2  2003/02/24 05:42:19  ddiego
*moved the code for the VariantData calss into it's own header
*migrated to the new event style using Delegates instead of relying on
*the ugly macros that we were using before - same functionality though
*made sure everything still works and compiles, including neccessary
*changes in the VCF Builder so that it creates code in the new style
*This changes to teh new style of using Delegates completes task 58837
*
*Revision 1.2.14.1  2003/01/08 00:19:58  marcelloptr
