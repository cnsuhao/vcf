*Revision 1.1.2.1  2004/04/28 03:29:39  ddiego
*migration towards new directory structure
*
*Revision 1.2  2003/12/18 05:15:56  ddiego
*merge from devmain-0-6-2 branch into the stable branch
*
*Revision 1.1.2.2  2003/10/04 20:14:59  ddiego
*aaddec changes to support compiling on GCC 3.3.1, which is much more
*picky than some of the previous versions.
*
*Revision 1.1.2.1  2003/09/12 16:46:33  ddiego
*finished adding header changes to improve compile speed (at least
*with MS VC++) and to get rid of some of the clutter that the RTTI macros
*add.
*But Where'd the RTTI info go!?!?
*Have no fear it's still there! It is now located in three .inl files, one
*for each kit. Each kit will consolidate it's RTTI decls in the following
*files:
*FoundationKit:
*  vcf/include/FoundationKitRTTI.inl
*GraphicsKit:
*  vcf/include/GraphicsKitRTTI.inl
*ApplicationKit:
*  vcf/include/ApplicationKitRTTI.inl
*
*Please alter these files as neeccessary to add/subtract/alter the various
*RTTI info. Each kit is also responsible for registering any of the class
*in the ClassRegistry.
*A side effect of this is that I had to alter the memory allocation for the
*VC6 build for the Application it went from /Zm120 to /Zm150. I find this
*pretty lame but I don't know what else to do. Hopefully this will improve
*compile times when using the Appkit in other programs.
