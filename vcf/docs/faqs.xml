			<question>
				<para>Why are you writing another framework ? Aren't there enough out there ?</para>
			</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
				The Visual Component Framework (VCF) was designed to make application 
				programming in general, particularly applications with User Interfaces, 
				much easier than it currently is with typical development tools. In addition 
				it was created to be cross platform in design, so a program relying only 
				on features within the VCF should simply recompile on another platform 
				supported by the VCF.
				</para>
			</answer>
			<question>
				<para>Regarding the copyright, is it open-source, gnu license, what are the rules
about that? I just saw the installer telling me you own the copyright, is that so?</para>
			</question>
			<answer>
				<para>The VCF license is a BSD license. The only restriction is that
				the copyright notice may not be stripped out from the source, and
				you need to give credit to the project and or author(s). Beyond
				that you are free to use the code however you like, and you are not
				<emphasis>required</emphasis> to release changes you make back to
				the VCF project (though they are certainly welcome). Copyright is 
				owned by the authors of the content.</para>
			</answer>
			<question>
				<para>How does the VCF compare to other frameworks or toolkits,
					such as MFC, Qt, FLTK, FOX, and GTK?</para>
			</question>
			<answer>
				<para></para>
			</answer>

			<question>
				<para>Why not just help out an existing framework? Why write 
					yet <emphasis>another</emphasis> framework/toolkit?</para>
			</question>
			<answer>
				<para>There are a variety of reasons, such as:
					<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>	<para>					
					One of the big ones is the dynamic nature of the 
					VCF due to the use of advanced RTTI features. For a number of frameworks this 
					would be difficult to fit in with out serious changes to the framework in question.
					</para></listitem>	
					<listitem>	<para>
					Another reason is simply the way the VCF is designed, for example the use of a Component
					base class for many of the UI controls, and the presence of Property and Component
					editors to support RAD design time editing. Supporting these requires certain features 
					that could be difficult to add in to an existing framework (this was partially the case 
					with wxWindows). 
					</para></listitem>	
					<listitem>	<para>
					Other issues are the usage of modern C++, such as templates, STL, namespaces, and exceptions. 
					These require a reasonably up to date C++ compiler (such as GCC, MS VC6 or VC7, 
					Borland C++, etc), and some of the existing toolkits place a high priority on supporting 
					older, non-standard	C++ compilers, which greatly reduces what features of the 
					C++ langauge are available to them.
					</para></listitem>	
					</itemizedlist>
				</para>
			</answer>
			<question>
				<para>Can we use the VCF in commercial applications?</para>
			</question>
			<answer>
				<para>Yes. There are no restrictions made on how the VCF is 
				used. It can used in both OSS and commercial/proprietary projects.</para>
			</answer>
			
			<question>
				<para>Is the VCF Documentation available in PDF format?</para>
			</question>
			<answer>
				<para>Not currently, though there is an effort to make this 
				happen. </para>
			</answer>
			
			<question>
				<para>Is the VCF Documentation available in HTML for offline viewing?</para>
			</question>
			<answer>
				<para>Yes, see the project downloads section and look for the
				Documentation area. </para>
			</answer>
			
			<question>
				<para>Is the VCF Documentation available as an HTML Help .CHM file?</para>
			</question>
			<answer>
				<para>Yes, see the project downloads section and look for the
				Documentation area.</para>
			</answer>
			
			<question>
				<para>What would be required to port my MFC App to VCF?</para>
			</question>
			<answer>
				<para>A miracle? Seriously porting an existing code in one framework to another
				is not a 5 minute job. It would partially depend on what features of MFC you make use of
				and how you built your app. Many of the function names are different or subtly different.
				The basic core concepts are pretty much the same, but the fundamental design of the two
				frameworks is quite different.</para>
			</answer>
			<question>
				<para>What platforms and/or compilers does the VCF support?</para>
			</question>
			<answer>
				<para>Currently the VCF runs on Win32 (Windows 98, Windows NT 4 sp4 or better, Windows 2000
						and Windows XP). A linux port (with the UI/graphics parts based on GTK) is currently 
						underway and making good progress). Some work has been done on MacOSX, but it is 
						sporadic at best.</para>
				<para>
				As far as supported compilers, the VCF is known to compile/link with:
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>	<para>
					Microsoft Visual C++ 6 (sp5)
					</para></listitem>
					<listitem>	<para>
					Microsoft Visual C++ 7
					</para></listitem>
					<listitem>	<para>
					GCC 2.95
					</para></listitem>
					<listitem>	<para>
					GCC 3.2
					</para></listitem>
				</itemizedlist>						
				</para>
			</answer>
			<question>
				<para>How are the resources handled between OS's?</para>
			</question>
			<answer>
				<para>On Win32 platforms resources are compiled into the executable using the toolchains rc compiler.
				For other platforms, the VCF will use whatever native support there is, or come up with an 
				appropriate scheme.</para>
			</answer>
			<question>
				<para>If a serious security/memory/whatever issue was found 18 months down 
				the track how is this handled? In general where do I go if I find bugs, and 
				if I do, how can I get them resolved?</para>

				<para></para>
			</answer>
			<question>
				<para>Why do I have to set environment variables?</para>
			</question>
			<answer>
				<para>The VCF uses three environment variables to identify the following:
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>	<para>
					Where the vcf/include directory is (as an absolute path), stored as VCF_INCLUDE.
					This is the base include directory.
					</para></listitem>
					<listitem>	<para>
					Where the vcf/lib directory is (as an absolute path), stored as VCF_LIB.
					This is the base library directory.
					</para></listitem>
					<listitem>	<para>
					GCC 2.95
					</para></listitem>
					<listitem>	<para>
					GCC 3.2
					</para></listitem>
